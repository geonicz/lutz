# Usage: % python sousa.py
# sousa.py uses getfile.py and playfile.py:
# was split into parts for reusability.
#
# getfile fetches (only) the Monty Python 
# theme song and saves the audio file,
# so it works anywhere you have an Internet 
# connection.  I've even used it from a DOS 
# box command line on Windows98, by dialing 
# in to an ISP via modem--it automatically 
# dials out if necessary.  
# 
# playfile uses the windows filename association
# for .au file (by running a start command), which
# usually brings up your default audio player (perhaps
# a web browser if nothing else is associated); on 
# UNIX it tries to run an audio filter instead;

# we could also use the top-level LaunchBrowser
# script to pass the .au file to a browser 
# portably (on Windows, the browser will in turn
# download the file and start your audio player); 
# for instance, the following is equivalent to 
# running sousa.py:
#
# C:\Stuff\Mark>python %X%\LaunchBrowser.py 
#                          -live ftp/python/misc/sousa.au www.python.org
