# use ftp to upload all files from a local dir to a remote site/directory;
# e.g., run me to copy an ftp site's files from your machine to your ISP,
# especially handy if you only have ftp access to your website, not a
# telnet/shell account access (else you could tar up all files and 
# transfer in a single step to the remote machine and untar there);
# to upload subdirectories too, use os.path.isdir(path), FTP().mkd(path),
# and recursion--see uploadall.py for a version that supports subdirs.
# note that we need 'rb' mode to write things like gif files, due to the
# automatic \r\n <=> \n mapping on MS-Windows in text mode; we could
# use 'rb' for text too, but ftplib makes all eolns '\r\n' either way;
# that means that text files show up in MS-DOS linefeed mode at the site.
