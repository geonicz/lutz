# use ftp to copy (download) all files from a remote site/directory to a 
# local dir; e.g., run me periodically from a unix cron job to mirror an ftp
# site; script assumes this is a flat directory--see the mirror program in 
# Python's Tools directory for a version that handles subdirectories;
# see uploadflat.py--use storbinary to upload, retrlines for text, etc.;
# could use binary xfer always, but doesn't map dos/unix line feeds;
# for gifs, etc., local file mode must be 'wb' (binary) not 'w' on Win98;
# the retrlines method strips crlf's on lines sent to the data callback,
# and a mode of 'w' maps the \n added here to \r\n on Win98 (not Unix);
# transfer block size defaults to 8K bytes if ommitted for retrbinary;
# getpass.getpass is like raw_input, but doesn't show input as typed;
# to mirror with subdirectories, parse the result of the FTP().dir()
# method to detect remote directories, use os.mkdir(path) to create
# local directories of same name, and recursion to download subdirs:
# see Tools/scripts/ftpmirror.py in the Python source distribution.
