# Decode mail attachments sent in base64 encoded
# form (and others). Rather than editing by hand,
# this version reads the entire mail message
# and fetches, decodes and writes each individual
# part to its own file.  It doesn't assume that
# the base64 encoded data has been extracted into
# a separate file.  Decodes uuencoded attachments 
# too.  mhlib uses mimetools.Message, multifile,
# and mimetools.decode.
#
# To use, copy mail message to mailfile and run:
#    % python ..\decodeAll.py mailfile
# which makes one or more mailfile.part* outputs.
# Also supports nested multipart encoding (parts
# within parts, e.g., text and html alternatives).
# On some platforms you can also simply point an 
# email client like Outlook at the file (e,g., on
# Windows, give the file a .eml extension and click)
# but this script is more portable, and may be more
# convenient especially if there are many parts.
