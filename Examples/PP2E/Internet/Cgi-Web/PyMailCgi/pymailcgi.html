This site implements a simple web-browser interface to POP/SMTP email
accounts.  Anyone can send email with this interface, but for security
reasons, you cannot view email unless you install the scripts with your
own email account information, in your own server account directory.
PyMailCgi is implemented as a number of Python-coded CGI scripts that run on
a server machine (not your local computer), and generate HTML to interact 
with the client/browser.  See the book <I>Programming Python, 2nd Edition</I>
for more details.</P>

<P>Caveats: PyMailCgi 1.0 was initially written during a 2-hour layover at 
Chicago's O'Hare airport.  This release is not nearly as fast or complete 
as PyMailGui (e.g., each click requires an Internet transaction, there
is no save operation, and email is reloaded often).  On the other hand, 
PyMailCgi runs on any web broswer, whether you have Python (and Tk) 
installed on your machine or not.  

<P>Also note that if you use these scripts to read your own email, PyMailCgi
does not guarantee security for your account password, so be careful out there.
See the notes in the View action page as well as the book for more information
on security policies.  Also see:

<li>The <I>PyMailGui</I> program in the Email directory, which
        implements a client-side Python+Tk email GUI
<li>The <I>pymail.py</I> program in the Email directory, which 
        provides a simple command-line email interface
<li>The Python imaplib module which supports the IMAP email protocol
        instead of POP
<li>The upcoming openSSL support for secure transactions in the new 
        Python 1.6 socket module
