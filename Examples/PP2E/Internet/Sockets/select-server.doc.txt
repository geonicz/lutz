# Server: handle multiple clients in parallel with select.
# use the select module to multiplex among a set of sockets:
# main sockets which accept new client connections, and 
# input sockets connected to accepted clients; the select
# call can either poll or wait for a set of input and output
# streams to be ready for reading and writing (and exceptions), 
# such that socket calls like accept and recv will not block;
# it works only on sockets under Windows, but also on things 
# like pipes on Unix anc Macs.  select is an alternative to 
# spawning threads and processes and provides good performance 
# for short transactions (but is still open to blocking in some 
# cases; also see asyncore.py in the Python standard library: a
# class based callback model dispatched by a select event loop;
# select takes 3 lists of selectable objects (input, output, 
# exceptions), plus a timeout; timeout may be a wait expiration
# in seconds, zero to mean poll and return immediately, or 
# ommitted to mean wait until at least one object is ready; 
# returns triple of ready objects--a subset of 1st 3 args,
# any or all of which may be empty if timeout expired; note
# that a time.sleep call to simulate long-running task doesn't
# make sense here--all clients handled on same, single loop;

ALSO: MAKING SOCKETS NON-BLOCKING:

setblocking (flag) 
  Set blocking or non-blocking mode of the socket: if flag is 0, the 
  socket is set to non-blocking, else to blocking mode. Initially all 
  sockets are in blocking mode. In non-blocking mode, if a recv() call 
  doesn't find any data, or if a send call can't immediately dispose of
  the data, a error exception is raised; in blocking mode, the calls 
  block until they can proceed.
